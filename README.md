### A Chrome extension that hides the difficulty tag of the problem and stops you from accessing any LeetCode profiles, including your own.

  ## 𝐐. 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐡𝐢𝐝𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐲 𝐭𝐚𝐠 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦? <br />
  <p>𝐀. This feature attempts to improve your performance by replacing the difficulty tag with a cute little- '💩' emoji. <br/>
  Knowing the problem's difficulty level before getting to solve it can create a mental blocker. Failing to solve an "Easy" one can lower your confidence and knowing that it's a "Hard" one, may make you give up early. <br/><br/>
  Also, hiding the difficulty makes the experience similar to interviews where you are not specifically informed of the level of difficulty. And so, you have a chance to approach the problem without bias. </p>
  
  ## 𝐐. 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞?
  <p>𝐀. This feature is an attempt to make you realise that there's always more to do 🚀.<br/><br/>
  
  FUCK THE POINTS, PLAY FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME. Points are just the signifiers— the Badges, the Contest Ratings, the amount of problems solved— and while they may be pleasurable, they don’t sustain you. If you play for the points, you will get rich and stop trying. Get lost in playing the game and stop worrying about the points. Points are just small tokens put there to distract and limit you.<br/><br/>

The extension prevents you from feeling like you're done once you get the green box for the day, or when you achieve a certain LeetCode Badge, or when you feel too good about yourself.<p/>

## 𝐐. 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐞𝐥𝐬𝐞'𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞?
<p>𝐀. This feature is an attempt to prevent you from falling into the trap of comparison 🎯.<br/><br/>

You may have just achieved your first Monthly LeetCoding Challenge Badge but looking at your friend's profile, you may find that he's been putting effort from before and has a couple more badges.<br/><br/>

The idea is if you find yourself checking out others' profiles more often than you should then you're probably taking your eyes off your own grass and checking how much greener everyone else’s is. Naturally, you might see several lawns that appeared greener than your own, which can ultimately fuel your sense of inferiority. <br/><br/>

However, the reality is that you may think that someone’s grass is greener than yours, but who knows, they might be copying solutions and increasing their problem count 🤷🏽‍♂️.<p/>
